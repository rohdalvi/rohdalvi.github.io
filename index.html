                In the summer of 2020, I worked as a Product Engineering Intern at Be a Maker Club, a startup based out of Greater Los Angeles, CA.  
                Here, I worked on a variety of tasks relating to early-stage product development.  I analyzed the target market, set quantitative and 
                qualitative goals for our product, and designed a mechatronic system using Autodesk Fusion 360 CAD software. Furthermore, I sourced 
                components and analyzed our design for manufacturability.

                I began the summer of 2020 working as a Summer Design Co-op at Toyota Motor North America in Saline, MI.  While this experience was unfortunately cut 
                short due to the COVID pandemic, I still greatly enjoyed my time at Toyota.  During my internship, I participated in a mobility challenge where
                I devised a marketing strategy to promote a new minivan.  Using Toyota's A3 report format, I created a plan to increase target market share by 5%
                through a combination of dealer training, TV ads, and Youtube videos.

                In the summer of 2019, I interned at BorgWarner Inc, a Tier 1 automotive supplier in Auburn Hills, MI.  
                As a member of the Noise, Vibration, and Harshness group, I performed a long-term project where I investigated abnormal torque fluctuations using HEAD Acoustics Artemis Suite.
                As a member of the Validation group, I wrote a MATLAB script that could rapidly process test data with the capability to save 30 minutes per data set.

                Michigan Electric Racing is a student-led design team that competes in SAE Formula Electric.  Currently, I am working on creating the car's dashboard and integrating the dashboard electronics.
                In the past, I lead the design of the steering system. Through this role, I have accomplished a number of tasks such as using MATLAB to analyze tire data for Ackerman angle calculations, using Siemens NX to CAD our
                steering system, and using ANSYS to ensure its strength.  Additionally, I have learned a great deal about effective leadership and communication.  Furthermore,
                I have loved motorsports since I was a small child and MER has given me the opportunity to be a part of that world.

                Northville High School Aerospace Club was founded in 2014 to provide opportunities for students to explore the field of aerospace 
                with hands-on projects.  I was one of the cofounders of this club, and also served as president.  My experiences ranged from 
                designing, assembling, and helping launch a weather balloon to acquiring a historic project aircraft and a hangar to store it in.  
                I also held multiple internal responsibilities, such as presenting weekly on the state of the club and leading our social media 
                effort, primairly through the use of Twitter Analytics.

                    The Village Workshop is a DIY space in my hometown of Northville, Michigan where people can come in and work on their personal projects.
                    I completed an internship here which gave me a solid foundation in real-world design and manufacturing.  For the workshop, I designed, 
                    machined, and painted a sign to advertise lumber for sale using Autodesk Inventor and a CNC machine.  I also machined and assembled a cart
                    for patrons to use to move plywood around the workshop.  This experience was a great introduction to a workshop environment and I was able
                    to learn how to operate basic workshop machinery and power tools efficiently and safely.
