                I am a Mechanical Engineering student in his second year at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor). I am extremely passionate about all things engineering, with a particular fondness for product development. 
                At Michigan, I am a member of the Michigan Electric Racing team.

            </h2>
            <h4>
                I have a varied skillset that I can utilize.  I am knowledgeable in a variety of CAD software packages, including Siemens NX, Solidworks, and Autocad Inventor.  
                Additionally, I have experience with Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS.  My background also extends to computer science, as I am familiar with C++, Python, Matlab, HTML, and CSS.

                <h2> Michigan Electric Racing is a student-led design team that competes in SAE Formula Electric.  Currently, I lead our steering team.
                     Through this role, I have accomplished a number of tasks such as using MATLAB to analyze tire data for Ackerman angle calculations, using Siemens NX to CAD our
                     steering system, and using ANSYS to ensure its strength.  Additionally, I have learned a great deal about effective leadership and communication.  The club has allowed me 
                     to gain extensive hands-on experience by applying theory learned in the classroom to real-world situations and problems.  Furthermore,
                     I have loved motorsport since I was a small child and MER has given me the opportunity to be a part of that world.

                <h2> Northville High School Aerospace Club was founded in 2014 to provide opportunities for students to explore the field of aerospace 
                    with hands-on projects.  I was one of the cofounders of this club, and also served as president.  My experiences ranged from 
                    designing, assembling, and helping launch a weather balloon to acquiring a historic project aircraft and a hangar to store it in.  
                    I also held multiple internal responsibilities, such as presenting weekly on the state of the club and leading our social media 
                    effort, primairly through the use of Twitter Analytics.
